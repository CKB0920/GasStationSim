I want the player to aim towards improving their performance in game. A small goal for players to chase throughout playing and progressing. This could improve things like the speed at which the player completes certain tasks. Cleaning counters and mopping floors can happen faster. Machine cleaning can maybe even be improved by this depending on how I plan on implementing those cleaning minigames.

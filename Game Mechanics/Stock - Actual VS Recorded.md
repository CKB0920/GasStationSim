### Actual stock:
Game should always keep active track of what is in the store at all times.
How regularly this happens, I'm not sure.
This information should be hidden, only available for game functionality sake.
Why? This enables the player's recorded stock to be unknowingly altered by things like theft.

### Recorded Stock:
Stock measured by the player, or by an auditing service or inspection.
Could also be manually adjusted by the player.
Could be affected or tracked through sales and ordering ONLY.
	Imagine a spreadsheet or Store Inventory Management System (S.I.M.S) that would keep track of the player's stock. Every time an order is received, the items that are **CONFIRMED BY PLAYER**[^1] should add to the store's **RECORDED STOCK**.
	

[^1]:The list of finalized items actually received in the order after the player accounts for missing, damaged, or extra products.
